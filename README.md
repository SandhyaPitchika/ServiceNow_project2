# Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations

## Introduction
This project focuses on improving the efficiency of support operations by automating the ticket assignment process.  
Currently, tickets are manually assigned, which often causes delays, inconsistencies, and uneven workloads. These issues affect response times, reduce customer satisfaction, and create inefficiencies in support teams.  

The proposed solution introduces an **automated routing system** that ensures each support ticket is promptly assigned to the right team or agent, minimizing manual intervention and optimizing workload distribution.

## Objective
- Automate the assignment of support tickets to relevant teams or agents.  
- Improve response times and first-resolution accuracy.  
- Ensure balanced workload distribution across support staff.  
- Enhance customer satisfaction and internal efficiency.  

## Current Challenges
- **Misdirected tickets** → frequent reassignment delays.  
- **Uneven workload** among agents.  
- **Human errors** in manual routing.  
- **Slower response times** → reduced customer satisfaction.
  
## Proposed Solution
The automated routing system will:
- Use **predefined rules** (category, priority, team availability).  
- Optionally leverage **machine learning (ML)** to analyze ticket content.  
- Support **escalation paths** for unresolved tickets.  
- Allow supervisors to **manually override** assignments.  
- Provide **real-time dashboards and reports** for monitoring.  

## Project Scope
**In Scope:**
- Integration with the existing ticketing platform.  
- Configuration of classification and routing rules.  
- Real-time dashboards and reporting.  
- Training support staff.  

**Out of Scope:**
- Redesign of customer-facing ticket forms.  
- Changes to core support interfaces.  
- Integration with external/third-party ticketing systems (not in this phase).  

## Functional Requirements
- Identify key ticket info (category, urgency, intent).  
- Auto-assign tickets based on configured rules.  
- Support escalations for unattended tickets.  
- Enable supervisor-driven manual reassignment.  
- Trigger automated notifications upon assignment.  
- Maintain a log of all assignment actions for audit purposes.  

## Technical Overview
- **Backend:** Python / Node.js  
- **Frontend:** React (for rule configuration & dashboards)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Hosting:** AWS / Azure (scalable & secure)  
- **APIs:** Integration with existing ticketing platform  
- **ML (optional):** Scikit-learn / TensorFlow for advanced categorization

## Success Criteria
- Reduced **average assignment time**.  
- Higher **first-response resolution rates**.  
- Even workload distribution among support agents.  
- Increased **customer satisfaction scores** (via surveys).  
- Positive internal feedback from support staff.  

## Conclusion
By automating ticket assignment, the project will:
- Improve team productivity.  
- Reduce resolution times.  
- Enhance customer experience.  
- Align with organizational goals of **operational excellence** and **service quality improvement**.
